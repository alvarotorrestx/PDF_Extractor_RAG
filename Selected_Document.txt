Outline Plan Leprechaun Animation Implementation Gift Event 1. Research Process • Understand best practices for implementing animations on websites, focusing on user experience and performance. o Research Shopify’s integration options for animations and cart triggers. o Explore web animation best practices to ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and performance. o Study animation frameworks like CSS keyframes, HTML <canvas> , or Three.js for implementation flexibility. o Identify potential challenges with Shopify's Liquid and JavaScript integration. 2. Planning the Graphic • Character Design: o Create a lightweight SVG or PNG graphic of the leprechaun for optimal performance. o If the graphic is not received well by the design team, collaborate to refine the design or consider alternative visuals that align better with the brand. • Responsive Adaptation: o Use CSS media queries and JavaScript calculations to dynamically adjust the character’s size and position based on screen dimensions. 3. Functionality and Behavior • Trigger Appearance: o Monitor the cart value using Shopify’s Liquid templates or JavaScript. The leprechaun will appear when the cart total equals or exceeds $100. • Animation Behavior: o Default Behavior: Use CSS keyframes or JavaScript to create a jumping animation that stays within browser boundaries. o Alternative Behavior: Allow the animation to pass the screen’s boundaries and re-enter from the opposite side, creating a playful loop. • Catch Mechanism: o Treat the leprechaun graphic as a button with an onclick event. Clicking it triggers an "add to cart" script for a free item (gift). o Once clicked, hide the animation and prevent it from reappearing if the gift is later removed from the cart. o If the cart balance should fall below $ 100, present an error message advising that they will lose the item un less they continue w ith a $100+ balance. • User Notification: o Include a modal box or tooltip when the leprechaun first appears, informing the user: “Catch the leprechaun to claim your free gift!” o Use a subtle animation (e.g., pulsing or glowing) to draw attention to the graphic. 4. Accessibility • Ensure compliance with Shopify’s accessibility guidelines. • Add ARIA labels to the leprechaun button for screen readers: "Catch the leprechaun to claim a free gift!" • Test motion settings for users who prefer reduced motion and provide a toggle to disable the animation if necessary. 5. Shopify Integration • Embed custom JavaScript and Liquid logic directly into the theme to manage animation and cart logic. • Use Shopify’s Admin API to handle dynamic cart updates. • Collaborate with the design and marketing teams to ensure seamless integration with the site’s overall aesthetic. 6. User Notifications • Notify users of the animation’s purpose through: o A tooltip or modal box when the leprechaun appears. o A success message once the user catches the leprechaun and the gift is added to the cart. • Maintain simplicity to avoid overwhelming the user experience. 7. Testing • Device and Browser Compatibility: o Test the animation across multiple devices and browsers, ensuring responsiveness and performance. • Performance Optimization: o Use the company’s CDN to minimize load times by caching assets like the leprechaun graphic and scripts. • Accessibility Tests: o Ensure compatibility with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and motion sensitivity settings. 8. Tools and Resources • Animation Tools: o CSS keyframes for lightweight animations. o HTML <canvas> or Three.js for more complex interactions. • Development Tools: o Shopify Developer Tools and API documentation. o Chrome DevTools for debugging and performance monitoring. • Accessibility Resources: o Shopify Accessibility Documentation and tools like Lighthouse or accessWidget for compliance testing. 9. Deployment and Maintenance • Use Shopify’s theme editor or a custom app for deployment. • Monitor performance metrics and user feedback to iterate and improve the feature. • Plan a fallback behavior for browsers that don’t support advanced animations.
